\section*{Abstract}
Communication intensive applications that leverage modern multicore CPU and high-speed networking hardware often put 
considerable stress on traditional socket implementation. Existing Linux socket is implemented in the kernel 
space with several shared data structures that needs concurrency protection. This incur significant kernel crossing 
and locking overhead.
