\section*{Abstract}

%Linux socket is implemented in the kernel space with shared data structures that needs concurrency protection, which incurs significant overhead.
Communication intensive applications in hosts with multi-core CPU and high speed networking hardware often put considerable stress on the native socket system in an OS. 
Existing attempts of socket replacements often leave significant performance on the table, while have limitations on compatibility, isolation and multi-thread scalability.
%Communication intensive applications on modern computers with multi-core CPU and high-speed networking hardware 
%often put considerable stress on traditional socket implementation. 
%This design incurs significant kernel crossing and locking overhead.
%Recent user-space sockets often do not support intra-host communication among containers and applications, or have limitations on compatibility, isolation and scalability with multiple threads and concurrent connections.

%In this paper, we describe \sys{}, a high performance socket system that is fully compatible with Linux and can be used as a drop-in replacement with no modification to applications.
%\sys{} is implemented in user space to avoid kernel crossing cost and simplify deployment.
%Each host runs a monitor daemon to securely process the control plane, while the data plane bypasses the monitor.
%We achieve multi-thread scalability by considering threads as a shared-nothing message passing distributed system.
%To improve memory locality, we multiplex all connections and event notifications between a pair of threads via one queue.
%We use a high performance shared memory queue for intra-host communication.
%For inter-host communication, we take advantage of modern RDMA hardware, but can also transparently communicate with regular TCP/IP endpoints.
%Together with carefully designed zero-copy mechanism and cooperative multitasking, it removes many overheads of existing socket systems.
%Experiment shows that \sys{} achieves 4 to 24x message throughput, 10 to 60x better latency, and over 40x connection setup throughput compared with Linux socket.


In this paper, we describe \sys, a user-space high performance socket system. \sys is fully compatible with Linux socket and can be used as a drop-in replacement with no modification to existing applications. The design fully handles Linux fork semantics, container live migration, and both intra- and inter-host communications with hosts equipped with \sys as well as those without. \sys achieves security and isolation by employing a trusted monitor daemon to handle control plane operations such as connection establishment and access control. \sys is implemented in user space to avoid kernel crossing cost, and uses shared memory and RDMA efficiently for intra- and inter-host communication. It removes multi-thread synchronization in common cases, and leverages techniques such as page remapping and cooperative multitasking to reduce overheads. Experiments show that \sys achieves 7 to 20x better message throughput, 17 to 35x better latency, and 20x connection setup throughput compared with Linux socket.
