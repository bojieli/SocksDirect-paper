\section*{Abstract}
Communication intensive applications on modern computers with multicore CPU and high-speed networking hardware 
often put considerable stress on traditional socket implementation. 
Linux socket is implemented in the kernel space with several shared data structures that needs concurrency protection. 
This design incur significant kernel crossing and locking overhead. 

In this paper, we describe \sys{}, a high performance socket system. 
\sys{} is implemented in user space to avoid kernel crossing cost. It achieves multicore scalability 
by designing the socket system as a shared-nothing message passing distributed system.
\sys{} use a high performance shared memory lockless queue for intra-server communication. For inter-server communication, 
it can take advantage of modern RDMA hardware, but can also communicate with regular TCP/IP endpoints.
Together with carefully designed zero-copy mechanism, it removes many overheads of existing socket systems. 

\sys{} is fully compatible with Linux socket and can be used as a drop-in replacement with no modification to the user applications. 
Experiment shows that \sys achieves 4 to 24x better message throughput, 10 to 60x better RTT latency, and over 40x connection 
throughput compared with Linux socket.
