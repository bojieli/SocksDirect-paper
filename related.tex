\section{Related Work}
\label{sec:related}

There has been extensive work aiming to make the best use of multi-core CPU and data center network. Table~\ref{tab:related-work} categorizes several representative approaches.

\parab{Linux kernel optimization.}
One line of research optimize the kernel stack for higher socket performance. FastSocket~\cite{lin2016scalable} and Affinity-Accept~\cite{pesterev2012improving} scale connection creation to multiple cores, but synchronization is still needed when multiple threads share a socket.
FlexSC~\cite{soares2010flexsc} proposes exception-less system calls to reduce kernel crossing overhead.
Zero-copy socket~\cite{thadani1995efficient,chu1996zero} still needs copy-on-write on senders.
In addition, they fail to remove cache miss and transport overheads.


\parab{New OS stacks.}
Another line of research propose new OS stacks with modified socket interface, mostly aiming at zero copy and fast event notification. Existing socket applications need modifications to use the new interfaces.
For intra-server connections, Arrakis~\cite{peter2016arrakis} and IX~\cite{belay2017ix} use the NIC to forward packets from one process to another. The hairpin latency from CPU to NIC is at least two PCIe delays, which is one order of magnitude higher than inter-core cache migration delay. In addition, the data plane switching throughput of a NIC is constrained by PCIe bandwidth (Figure~\ref{fig:eval-corenum-tput}).
For inter-server communication, IX~\cite{belay2017ix} and Stackmap~\cite{yasukata2016stackmap} run in the kernel to enforce QoS policy or preserve protocol compatibility with Linux, while Arrakis~\cite{peter2016arrakis} and SandStorm~\cite{marinos2014network} run in user mode to maximize performance.
Virtualization works, \textit{e.g.} LITE~\cite{tsai2017lite} and NetKernel~\cite{niu2017network} also enforce QoS in the hypervisor.
Due to the additional level of indirection, kernel stacks cannot remove kernel crossing, while batched syscalls add latency.
Further, large-scale deployment of kernel-based stacks is more complicated than user-space libraries~\cite{andromeda}.


\sys offloads transport and QoS to NIC hardware.
RDMA transport has been deployed in many data centers~\cite{guo2016rdma}, and an emerging line of work~\cite{zhu2015congestion,lu2017memory,mprdma} improves congestion control and QoS for large-scale RDMA deployment.
For flexibility, programmable NICs are being adopted in data centers~\cite{smartnic,cavium}, as they are more efficient than general-purpose CPUs for network processing~\cite{kaufmann2015flexnic,li2016clicknp}.



\parab{User-space socket.}
A third line of approach is user-space sockets.
mTCP~\cite{jeong2014mtcp}, Seastar~\cite{seastar} and 
F-stack~\cite{fstack} use a high performance packet I/O framework (\textit{e.g.} PacketShader~\cite{han2010packetshader}, DPDK~\cite{dpdk} and PF\_RING~\cite{pf-ring}) and achieves compatibility with most Linux socket functions and scalability with number of cores and sockets.
LibVMA~\cite{libvma}, OpenOnload~\cite{openonload} and DBL~\cite{dbl} are fully compatible with existing applications. However, they use vendor-specific NIC features and do not scale to multiple threads or connections.
In addition, user-space sockets do not support zero copy or efficient multitasking.

Most user-space sockets focus on inter-server and do not optimize for intra-server connections.
FreeFlow~\cite{freeflow} uses shared memory for intra-server communication and RDMA for inter-server, but it provides an RDMA interface.
Existing socket to RDMA translation approaches, \textit{e.g.} SDP~\cite{socketsdirect} and rsockets~\cite{rsockets} are not fully compatible with Linux and do not address scalability challenges.


%\parab{RDMA.}
%First, RDMA is not suitable for WAN. Second, RDMA has scalability issue when one server connects to many servers. Software transport in CPU access connection states in host memory, while hardware RDMA transport caches connection states in NIC and swaps out to host memory when cache overflows. First, CPU cache miss costs less than 0.1$\mu$s, while NIC cache miss costs 0.5$\mu$s~\cite{kaminsky2016design}. Second, CPU memory bandwidth is an order of magnitude larger than NIC PCIe bandwidth. In light of this, a host should switch to software transport when it actively communicates with a large number of hosts. Fortunately, Modern NICs has an increasing size of memory and supports more active connections without performance degradation~\cite{kaminsky2016design}.
