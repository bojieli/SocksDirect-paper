\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

The socket API is considered a major obstacle for high performance. We design \sys, a high performance user-space socket architecture that is compatible with existing applications and preserves isolation among processes, while being scalable to multiple cores and many concurrent connections. We build \sys to leverage different communication options and achieve performance that is close to the limits of underlying hardware. Concretely, we use shared memory for intra-server sockets and one-sided RDMA write for inter-server sockets. To remove synchronization overhead, we consider processes as a share-nothing distributed system that communicates via message passing. We optimize for the common case and prepare for the worst case. We improve the page remapping technology for zero copy sockets. Evaluations show that \sys achieves high throughput and low latency for both intra-server and inter-server socket, while scales with number of connections and number of cores.
