There are several scalability problems in using one or more dedicated cores accelerate distributed coordination.
First, when the number of synchronization objects are large, \textit{e.g.}, one lock per record in databases and the access pattern is close to uniformly random, the throughput is bound by random access to non-cached memory, due to limited parallelism in a CPU core~\cite{lim2014mica}.
Second, when one CPU core is not capable to coordinate the requests, synchronization objects are distributed to multiple coordination cores. However, load imbalance may occur for highly contended objects, \textit{e.g.}, sequencers, socket accept queues and locks for extremely popular database entries.
Finally, when networking and synchronization is not the bottleneck, the dedicated cores are still polling, wasting energy and CPU resources.
